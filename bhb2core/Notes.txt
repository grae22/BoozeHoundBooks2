Architecture
------------

This is an attempt at a iDesign (Juval Lowey) style architecture.

Data access
 - Purely data access orientated, no business logic.
 - Examples: AddAccount, UpdateTransaction, etc. 

Engines
 - Provide focussed methods which implement business rules, each for achieving a single business action.
 - Examples: AddAccount

Managers
 - Fulfill use-cases by orchestrating business functionality in the engines.
 - Examples: ProcessTransaction

Tests
-----

Unit-tests target behaviours rather than simply testing a single class - that is, vertical slices of functionality.
